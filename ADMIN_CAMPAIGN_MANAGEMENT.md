# Admin Campaign Management Features ✅

const canEditFully = isAdmin || campaign.status === 'draft';

```

## Dashboard Updates

**New Dashboard Philosophy:**

2. **Draft Campaigns** - Editable campaigns with milestones count
3. **Live Campaigns** - Active campaigns with funding progress bars
4. **Completed Campaigns** - Finished campaigns with final results

**Campaign Cards Show:**
- Status badges (Draft, Live, Funded, Completed)
- Key metrics (funding progress, backer count, comments)
- Quick action buttons (Edit, Manage, View, Preview)
- Creation dates and milestone counts

### ✅ First-Time User Experience
**No Campaigns Onboarding:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Welcome!                │
│         Ready to launch your        │
│         first campaign?             │

## Error Handling & Feedback

### Comprehensive Error Messages
**Admin-Specific Errors:**

- `user-not-found`: "User not found. Please check the email address."

## Database Schema Support

### Foreign Key Relationships
**Properly configured cascade deletions:**
- Campaign deletion → Auto-deletes milestones, pledges, comments, team members
- User deletion → Restricted if user has campaigns/pledges/comments
- Team member deletion → Clean removal without affecting campaign

### Admin Role Enforcement
**Role-Based Access Control:**
```typescript
if (!session || !session.roles?.includes('admin')) {
  redirect('/signin');
}
```

## Security Considerations
