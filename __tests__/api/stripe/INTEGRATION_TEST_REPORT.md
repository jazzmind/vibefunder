```
✓ Webhook retry with exponential backoff
✓ Circuit breaker pattern implementation
✓ Dead letter queue simulation
✓ Stress testing under load
```

#### ❌ **webhook-integration.test.ts** - SYNTAX ERROR
```
❌ Compilation failed due to syntax error at line 1267
```
**Issue**: File structure issue preventing compilation
**Status**: Enhanced integration tests implemented but file has compilation error

## 📊 Cross-Component Dependency Analysis

### Database Integration Layer
```
Webhook → Database Updates → Campaign State Changes

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Integration Test Features

1. **Event Correlation System**
   ```typescript
   const eventSequence: Array<{
     type: string;
     timestamp: number;
     processed: boolean;
   }> = [];
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Error Scenarios**
   ```typescript
   const errorScenarios = [
     'Connection Timeout with Recovery',
     'Lock Timeout with Retry',
     'Transient Network Issues'
   ];
   ```

3. **Cross-Component State Validation**
   ```typescript
   // Ensures database consistency across concurrent operations
   expect(campaignUpdate).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(4);
   expect(pledgeCreation).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(4);
   ```

## 🚨 Known Issues & Recommendations

### Critical Issues
1. **webhook-integration.test.ts Compilation Error**
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Impact**: Enhanced integration tests cannot run
   - **Recommendation**: Fix syntax error at line 1267

### Performance Considerations
1. **Memory Usage in Garbage Collection Test**
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Impact**: Test threshold exceeded by ~13MB
   - **Recommendation**: Optimize memory usage or adjust test thresholds

### Enhancements for Future Consideration
1. **Database Transaction Isolation**
   - Consider implementing proper transaction boundaries for webhook processing
   - Add rollback mechanisms for partial failures

2. **Webhook Event Deduplication**
   - Implement proper idempotency keys for webhook events
   - Add database-level constraints to prevent duplicate processing

3. **Monitoring and Alerting Integration**
   - Add metrics collection for webhook processing
   - Implement alerting for failed webhook patterns
