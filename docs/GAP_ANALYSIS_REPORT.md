- ❌ No security headers middleware
- ❌ No secrets scanning in CI

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

2. **Implement Real OAuth**: Replace mock OAuth with actual GitHub/Google integration
3. **Add Stripe Integration**: Connect payment processing for pledges
4. **Create Escrow System**: Build fund management infrastructure

### Short-term (Weeks 2-4)
1. **Complete Milestone Workflow**: Evidence submission and acceptance
2. **Build Partner Marketplace**: Services and work orders
3. **Implement Webhooks**: Event-driven architecture
4. **Add File Storage**: S3 integration for artifacts

### Medium-term (Months 2-3)
1. **Enterprise Features**: SAML SSO, advanced compliance
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed reporting and insights
3. **API Platform**: Full REST API with documentation
4. **Mobile Support**: Responsive design improvements

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **No Payment Processing**: Cannot accept real funds
2. **No Escrow System**: Cannot manage milestone-based releases
3. **Missing KYC**: Regulatory compliance issues
4. **No Real OAuth**: Security vulnerability with mock auth

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Incomplete Milestone Workflow**: Poor user experience
2. **No Partner Services**: Missing revenue opportunity
3. **Limited API**: Integration challenges
4. **No Webhooks**: Manual processes required

## Conclusion

The VibeFunder platform has a solid foundation with 65% of features implemented. The core campaign management, user system, and administrative features are well-developed. However, critical financial infrastructure (payment processing, escrow, milestone releases) and marketplace features (partner services, work orders) are missing.

**Key Strengths:**
- Well-structured codebase with TypeScript
- Comprehensive campaign management
- Strong administrative features
- Good UI/UX foundation

**Critical Gaps:**
- No actual payment processing
- Missing escrow system
- Incomplete milestone workflow
- No partner marketplace

**Recommended Path Forward:**
Focus on implementing the payment and escrow system first, as this is fundamental to the platform's value proposition. Once financial infrastructure is in place, complete the milestone evidence workflow and partner services to deliver the full marketplace experience.

**Estimated Time to MVP:** 6-8 weeks with focused development on critical path items.
