# ApplicationAI — Charter Backer Invitation
**Date:** August 02, 2025  
**From:** [Your Company]  
**Venue/Law:** Massachusetts, USA

## TL;DR
Join **5** charter backers to harden **ApplicationAI** from prototype to enterprise-grade. Contribute **$20,000**; receive **lifetime org access**, roadmap influence, and **source-code escrow** for continuity. Funds sit in milestone escrow; no equity, no rev-share.

## Problem
Evaluating inbound startups, grant applications, and bids is slow and inconsistent. Data is scattered, submitters omit key info, and reviewers lack a common format.

## Solution
Turn a company URL into a complete application package. We auto-fill forms (Perplexity-assisted retrieval), run a submitter chat to gather missing info, let the submitter review/approve, enrich with market/competitor signals, and generate a standardized, explainable **go/no-go** brief.

## What you get
- **Lifetime internal-use license** (or 5-Year All-Inclusive).  
- **Deployment:** SaaS, your VPC, or on-prem.  
- **Code continuity:** escrow with trigger-based access.  
- **Security & compliance pack:** questionnaire answers, DPA, audit logs/export.  
- **Roadmap influence:** quarterly charter council.

## Core v1 Capabilities
- URL → profile (team, traction, docs) with citations.  
- **Submitter copilot**: secure link to resolve missing fields.  
- Enrichment: market sizing, comps, risks; explainability cards.  
- Auto-scored rubric + human review workflow; CRM/ATS export (Affinity, HubSpot, Salesforce).  
- Audit trail; data export; admin console.

## Milestones, Dates & Escrow
- **M1 Security & Identity (30%) — due 2025-09-08**: SSO (SAML/OIDC), RBAC, audit logging, SBOM/SCA, pen test.  
- **M2 Reliability & Data (40%) — due 2025-10-20**: SLOs/alerting, backups/restore drills, rate limits, admin console, exports.  
- **M3 Compliance & Fit (30%) — due 2025-11-24**: security questionnaire pack, DPA, deployment guides, badging.

## Budget & Mechanics
- Target budget **$100,000** = 5 × $20,000 (escrowed).  
- Funds released upon milestone acceptance (30/40/30) with 10-day review windows.  
- Optional maintenance: **$5k/yr** for upgrades & security updates.

## Success Measures
- Time-to-first qualified application < **10 minutes**.  
- Reviewer hours saved per 100 apps > **40%**.  
- AI pre-score vs. committee correlation **≥ 0.75** (Spearman).  
- **Zero** data-leakage incidents; P0 bugs ≤ 1/mo.
