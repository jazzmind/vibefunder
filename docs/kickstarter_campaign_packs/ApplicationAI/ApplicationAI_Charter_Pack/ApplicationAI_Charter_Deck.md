# ApplicationAI — Charter Backer Briefing

- Date: August 02, 2025
- Charter access • Code escrow • Milestone escrow (30/40/30)
- Audience: VC funds & innovation programs

> Notes: Open by framing the pain: demo is easy, enterprise hard. We’re here to fund the hardening with 5 charter backers.

# Problem

- Inbound is messy: missing fields, scattered docs, inconsistent review
- Time-to-qualification is slow; reviewers lack standard briefs
- Security & compliance block adoption

> Notes: Anchor on time wasted and risk. Mention that existing CRMs capture, they don’t evaluate.

---

# Solution

- URL → Application: auto-fill forms with citations
- Submitter copilot to resolve gaps, then approve
- Enrichment: market/comps/risks → explainable go/no-go brief

> Notes: Transition to demo flow next.
