# ApplicationAI — Charter Backer Invitation
**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Audience:** VC firms, competition managers, procurement triage teams

## TL;DR
Join 5 charter backers to fund hardening from prototype to enterprise-grade. Contribute **$20,000**; receive **lifetime org access**, priority roadmap input, and **source-code escrow** for continuity. Funds are milestone-escrowed; no equity, no rev-share.

## Problem & Solution
Turn a company URL or brief into a complete, evaluable application: auto-populate forms (Perplexity-assisted retrieval), chat with the submitter to fill gaps, submitter review, then enrich with market/competitor analysis and risk signals; generate standardized go/no-go summaries for VC dealflow, grant competitions, and RFP triage.

## What you get
- Lifetime internal-use license (non-transferable) or 5-Year All-Inclusive (your choice).
- Deployment options: SaaS / your VPC / on-prem.
- Source-code escrow with continuity triggers.
- Quarterly charter council; vote on priorities.
- Security & compliance artifacts (questionnaire pack, DPA, audit logs).

## Core capabilities (v1)
- URL → profile: scrape + enrich (team, traction, docs).
- AI copilot chat with submitter to resolve missing fields (secure link).
- Enrichment: market sizing, comps, risks, citations.
- Auto-scored rubric + human review workflow; decision-ready summary.
- Exports to CRM/ATS; audit trail and explainability cards.

## Milestones & Timeline (12–20 weeks)
- **M1 Security & Identity (30%)**: SSO (SAML/OIDC), RBAC, audit logging, SBOM/SCA, pen test.
- **M2 Reliability & Data (40%)**: SLOs, alerting, backups/restore drills, rate limits, admin console, exports.
- **M3 Compliance & Enterprise Fit (30%)**: questionnaire bundle, DPA, deployment guides, badging.

- **Application-specific:**
- URL→Application pipeline completes on 50-sample test set with >95% required field fill rate.
- Submitter chat achieves >80% completion without human assist on test cohort.
- Enrichment cards show sources with ≥90% resolvable citations.
- Rubric scoring reproducible with fixed seeds; CRM export validated (Affinity + HubSpot).

## Budget & Mechanics
