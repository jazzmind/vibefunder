Subject: Co-design CompetitionManager: charter access + code continuity

Hi {FirstName},

We’re inviting a handful of universities, corporates, foundations to co-design **CompetitionManager**. Contribute **$20k** as a charter backer (funds in escrow), and you’ll receive **lifetime org access**, roadmap influence, and **source-code escrow** for continuity. No equity; just outsized value on a tool built to your workflows.

We have a working prototype and can demo on sanitized data. Your top three workflows will shape v1 for CompetitionManager.

If helpful, we’ll run a 30-minute demo on sanitized data this week. Interested in a quick call?

Best,
