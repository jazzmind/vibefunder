# Rfp ProposalHub — Charter Backer Invitation
**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Audience:** capture teams, agencies, GovCon

## TL;DR
Join 5 charter backers to fund hardening from prototype to enterprise-grade. Contribute **$20,000**; receive **lifetime org access**, priority roadmap input, and **source-code escrow** for continuity. Funds are milestone-escrowed; no equity, no rev-share.

## Problem & Solution
Convert messy RFPs and sales conversations into winning proposals. Generate structured requirements, pull answers from a knowledge base of past proposals, assemble compliant drafts, and turn discovery calls into RFPs your team can issue.

## What you get
- Lifetime internal-use license (non-transferable) or 5-Year All-Inclusive (your choice).
- Deployment options: SaaS / your VPC / on-prem.
- Source-code escrow with continuity triggers.
- Quarterly charter council; vote on priorities.
- Security & compliance artifacts (questionnaire pack, DPA, audit logs).

## Core capabilities (v1)
- RFP ingestion: PDF/Docx/email → structured spec (sections/requirements).
- Conversation → requirements (call transcript ingestion).
- Proposal assembler: reusable blocks, pricing tables, schedules, compliance matrices.
- KB builder from past proposals with citation-backed retrieval.
- Reviewer workflows; red-team checks; export to Word/Google Docs.

## Milestones & Timeline (12–20 weeks)
- **M1 Security & Identity (30%)**: SSO (SAML/OIDC), RBAC, audit logging, SBOM/SCA, pen test.
- **M2 Reliability & Data (40%)**: SLOs, alerting, backups/restore drills, rate limits, admin console, exports.
- **M3 Compliance & Enterprise Fit (30%)**: questionnaire bundle, DPA, deployment guides, badging.

- **RFP-specific:**
- Ingest 20-sample RFP set → structured spec with ≥95% key field extraction accuracy (human-labeled).
- Proposal draft generation fills ≥90% of mandatory sections using KB with citations.
- Compliance matrix exported and validated in CSV and Docx.
- Round-trip editing preserves structure (Word/Google Docs).

## Budget & Mechanics
- Target budget: **$100,000** = 5 × $20,000 (escrowed).
- Funds released per milestone acceptance (30/40/30) with 10-day review windows.
- Optional maintenance plan: **$5k/yr** for upgrades & security updates.
- Add-ons available (below).

## Recommended add-ons
- E-Sign and intake portal.
- Pricing configurator adapter (CPQ).
- GovCon compliance pack (FAR/DFARS mapping).
- Multi-language localization pack.

## Success metrics
- Draft time reduced by 70% vs baseline.
- Compliance matrix completeness ≥ 95%.
- Win-rate lift on comparable deals after 90 days.
- Hallucination citation error rate ≤ 1% on test set.
