**AI Accuracy Issues:** Multi-model ensemble with human validation loops and confidence scoring means you always know when to double-check results.

**Market Adoption:** With proven demand from beta customers and industry validation, we're not building something people might want - we're scaling something they already need.

**Competition from Big Tech:** Our specialized focus on investment diligence and deep domain expertise gives us a sustainable competitive moat against generic solutions.
