So are there any any questions or areas you want us to focus on specifically or you just want us to like let's talk through it again and show you the demo and then kind of scope out what you think would be most useful I think that would probably be the best best way to go about it OK all right so so Wes why don't you Are you ready to jump in and show some stuff or you want some more time or what that would be great I I just wanna it would be good if we could just start just going through the workflow because I'd love to be able to connect some of the demos things back into the workflow yeah so I think our understanding is that you sort of have a four stage or version yeah workflow process and um and I might just try to reflect my understanding of it uh let me pull it up on screen so we at least yeah are are talking to the same sheet of music alright let me just get it who's gonna say and then I can if it'll help help be helpful for you I'm happy to kind of walk through just like what the the process looks for most generally yeah alright I also I have the template that we usually use as an initial write up for most potential clients that I'm happy to run through as well alright so here we've got the e-mail I can pull up the I have this is it the template you're talking about the word doc vector its vector or is that a partly filled out one menu here's the word doc that we have ohh yeah yeah that yeah that's one filled that one yeah OK alright so let's start with the e-mail and why don't you talk through how things currently work with you know version we'll just go line by line and when I when we see version is that the same thing as like a stage yeah basically yeah version 1 is is that template and then usually it gets updated a little bit to be version 2 and then it moves to a different document OK but I can alright so different yeah so why don't you walk through start to finish and we can take notes you got the recording Wes can think on his end and we can then envision what like where are the points of automation like what are the things that automation is good at because you you definitely like you need human in the loop right like you need someone who's an expert to to be able to pick the stuff that's wrong that the AI does right yeah and it's it's very good for the 80% maybe 90% but you know if it does do you wanna catch the tab you absolutely want to catch the 10 cause you're you know you want to be the one signing off on it so why don't you start with walking through this process and we'll we'll we'll go from there happy to him please interrupt at any point if you have questions and Sophia please jump in if I'm if I'm missing anything typically what is going to happen first will get an e-mail from one of the partners so Jonathan or jigger and it'll say something along on the lines of just had a conversation with ex CEO at this company and then usually either like a list of commentary from them like they're working on XYZ doing this here's their revenues here's why they're interested in working with us um will you guys go ahead and get started on 2 pager for them um ideally or if we're lucky we'll get an investor deck for some sort of internal material shared from the company but sometimes that is either on a little delay or sometimes we just don't you know have that to work off so it's either this commentary commentary and investor deck or just sort of what we can find out on the Internet and so with that we start on the two pager which is that template that you pulled up before and so we start to fill that out as much as we can with whatever the information that we have is doing some pretty light research online yeah exactly so 10,000 foot piece that's always filled out with us we try to make sure we get information their expectations is a little bit UM I I would say Sophia do agree like oftentimes that one's blank at least just in the beginning just because we don't necessarily know what exactly the company is looking for that would be a question so last time we talked um it sounds like the number of companies that multiplier will have at any given time is is 6 companies is that right uh I would say yeah full time companies probably 6 but we'll be working through like let me pull how many we're at right now because we will probably will sign about 6:00 and then we'll also have a bunch of other ones that are either in like early diligence or what have you OK and what do you see as the current goal is it exit is it raising external capital for project finance is it strategic or for multiplier for the company well for they expect like expectations for the company like what are they looking for what do they want so it it really it ranges I would say a lot of times it's connections with not often investors but connections with like strategic partners customers or understanding you know best path forward in terms of growth opportunities so if you're looking at you know should we explore market X or or market Z understanding that and just general kind of advisory work like that but not often coming with with an expectation of paying we want to raise this much money who should we raise it from oftentimes companies will come and say hey we're raising this round to do XY and Z and they want more advice I would say on what they're going to do with the money versus the the actual raise OK yeah and I will say expectations is probably one of the sections that at least for the first version we leave link and then we'll follow up more later and further versions OK good to keep moving Yep Yep uh just a real quick on that like for this this could be something that you know the expectations should be coming from the the company that's like why do you want to engage with us so it's almost like we so part of the automation is what can I do but you can also push work onto the CEO like we're not going to take your call until you fill out this more right like who you actually yeah yeah you need to let us know what we need from this yeah and I yeah sometimes it's as simple as like they have a a laundry list of things they need help when you have to figure out what's actually going to be the best what's the fit yeah yeah and other times it's we don't necessarily know what we want help on we know we want to move in this area can you help us do that um important technology this one is is definitely a challenge I think to fill out in a sort of objective and and not just taking the company's word for it manner a lot of times it's just kind of pulling from what's available online I'm like hey this company uses you know for example this one's AI to use analysis on computer types and and tariffs so it really is is hard for us to determine at least right off the bat like what is the the sort of differentiating factor for a company just based on you know if we see their pitch deck or whatever yes OK they have an AI tech but like it's usually pretty surface level but good to at least know what is the the big piece of their business that's important market size I I think this could be a really good area for the AI piece identifying what market the company actually operates in and ideally putting down like some sort of size and and growth feature of that market as well so what's the Jagger what's the you know the value of the market in the last year any other big players in the market that one is I think is really helpful for us to have and and that one is not something we necessarily need to pull from the company capitalization that one sometimes is is really just given straight up in a in a response from one of the partners or we'll look on something like crunch base or pitch book if we have access to that just to understand what the company has raised in the past you know a few years how much money are they raising and going forward steel attractiveness is blank um that's really left for partners to fill out just because it it really depends same with the interesting slash fit with expertise those are really not things that we're gonna comment on that's sort of for a jigger and Jonathan to say hey once we have all this information like what is it you know is this really going to fit with us are we actually able to help this company I would say the same thing about the maturity slash visibilities to success that's another one that's just sort of their commentary on management team oftentimes I would say it's sort of like a LinkedIn scrape if you will so finding out some background on key players or you know CEO CFO mainly focused on the C-Suite or early hires and then I like ideally we just write like a brief sort of laundry just like studied here yeah you do any do do any checks do you like say OK so and so is connected to them we know them well let's let's ask them then that would come from Jonathan or digger Lam and say that typically comes that does come up a little bit if it's hey CEO's or you know I'm friends with someone who's close with the CEO or because some of this could be like literally a ping on LinkedIn like message e-mail like activity it could be automated if they wanted to like yeah of course they could get on a call and they could do a zoom or whatever but like hey we're looking yeah yeah you gotta be sensitive about when and how you do that it's like hey we're looking at doing working out so yeah yeah not something you want to do right away but something that you can have sort of in the back if it's going there really everything else checks out OK let's get let's do some spot spot like very initial referrals it's not the specifics so questioning that's great great call out question on this one that last part of the sentence with good capital efficiency where did that likely come from like how did that get there that would probably be commentary from one of the partners just yeah on I mean I mean the information going into that obviously is just the their past burn rate and run rate and then what they raised in terms of capital and and how much they need to keep raising going forward versus their revenues so that's really just a commentary of like OK has this company raised a ton of money and ohh I see very little on sales or yeah company doing a really smart job and and really not raising more than they need and and just sticking very structured to to their approach yeah and and Jonathan or Jagger would be putting putting that in most likely would be would you agree with that I feel like that's usually a commentary from that yeah I feel like our first run down at least in my experience on the information is more informative than anything and then once jigger Jonathan read through that that's when they add their opinions and they're gonna like e-mail one of us off what they think and then we add that in to the write up yeah um location travel logistics that one's pretty straightforward that's usually where the company is located sometimes you will have companies where like the CEO is is in one place and the rest of the company is elsewhere just you know not earth shattering but important to note and then clear way to add value slash leverage expertise again I would say that's typically and and same with the one below it partner commentary for the most part I would say the only time that it's something that like we'll put in there as if it's a really clear connection you know if it's a solar company like Jagger is pretty pretty well versed in that space so I would say yeah there's a clear way to add value on that but typically that's them coming in and and speaking to the expectations that we're outlined above um disclosure there's rarely anything that's typically if like if jigger or Jonathan is invested in some way or has something they feel would be relevant for another partner to know just to to to go back to the good for multiplier brand kind of quality of investors that would be another thing where AI could potentially help by like pulling the list of investors yeah you know some level of ranking right so is it a good thing it's kind of it probably depends on the on the person's perspective right sometimes lower carbon is a positive sometimes is a negative you know so exactly and I think that's another good one where we will say that gets explored further in in the diligence process but I think it is a good point of like hey we know XYZ company has invested in them yeah but good to know not you know but it could be the kind of thing where like who decides what's good like what do you guys consider good brands and yeah exactly it's hard to say what's actually gonna be good versus what's just a feature metal outside there's not a ton in there usually I would say Sophie do you agree with that yeah that's that killed much of that that one's left pretty pretty basic key risks and diligence and that's where we'll add some partner commentary as we go further on and then also any sort of things that jump out like if there's any litigation or stuff like that against the company things like that that are are just important to be aware of or like for example CEO turnover if it's a new CEO and then there was some sort of turmoil related to and they're taking power like just an important note next steps and asks that typically is is either like one or two bullet points just from one of the partners saying like I want to follow up with this person who's in this space so it could be an interesting way to kind of link in that previous section we talked about if we know someone who's connected with them or something like that you know maybe they're worth following up and including it here perfect umm but yeah alright so then this is phase right this is phase one or phase two Yep sorry that's Phase 1 so that then would get sent to well that would get added to the companies folder on Dropbox and sent to both partners for any commentary or feedback so typically there's the lead partner that kind of initiates this whole process and then you know let's say jigger sent that out to us we share our one pager 2 pager back and then Jonathan will respond and say ohh like this seems interesting curious about XYZ and that gets us into version 2.0 so 2.0 is pretty it's basically just a continuation of that exact document and we usually just incorporate feedback from you know whatever the follow on partner says so if they you know are concerned about something that was outlined on there we'll make note of that on the document but not a ton typically you know changes from there it's more just general commentary you know what's the the gut reaction from one of the partners OK um alright from there if we get the kind of all clearing and go ahead we'll go into diligence just actually a question on \#2 how much of that could be done with e-mail or text but not like how much could you be like asking because like sending putting again putting the work on them so they could like this process could be a way like yeah you could get on a zoom you could do a call but like why not send them an e-mail with a with a form maybe fill this form out and then and then we'll have the call out one of the things I should also note in there we'll get feedback from the follow on partner of like hey I have these questions and that's usually when Sophia or I or both of us will meet with the company or reach out and send a list of questions to the company so that right now is a pretty manual process where like we you know Jonathan will respond with a list of Russians will add in our questions and have them organized by category and then that's gonna get sent to the company and wait for their feedback and so if you had some kind of chat interface with your folder on that company you could ask an LLM to come up with a list of questions in addition to your questions right like that would be an example of like helping come up with the questions exactly and that'd be fantastic because then we can sort of separate the one of the things I was speaking to Jonathan about this morning was separating kind of the commentary the partner commentary from the like actual questions we want to ask is what we don't want is sending a document to the client or customer with like hey so and so did this in the past like didn't really work out let's figure out why like we don't need to share that information with the customer right what we can say is what are they you know what are they looking at in terms of competitors or what are their revenues and like that's the the question that we need to get out there yeah not the commentary no yeah yeah no I agree I agree on the commentary but I like that's that's a good question it's like hey so and so tried this before why is it different not like that they should have an answer for that right yeah yeah yeah OK so typically then when we ask all those questions we'll get responses back and you know just a Word document and we will move on to the diligence piece do you have a copy of the diligence document so so do you want me to do you wanna pull it up on your side yeah let me pull it up real quickly so pretty similar um share can you guys see that OK I'm gonna move it to my bigger screen here hold on umm alright so from the kind of questions that we'll get back or the answers we get back from the company if everything kind of seems good there's no initial red flags we'll move into the diligence portion it's sort of like diligence light it's not anywhere near BC level of of digging and looking for skeletons in the closet or anything like that it's really just wanting to make sure we have a full idea of the company so broken down into these kind of categories that you'll see and we fill all this out typically like the associate or junior employee will write in blue just to have that separate and then the the black is sort of just information that is online that that we know is accurate so this is some of the information is repeated from the initial document but a lot of this is is meant to be new like the origin story is a good example of rather than just a list of here's the CEO here's where they went to school this is alright like why are they in this business so this is you know 17 years in the solar space realized that the business you know switching was complete like this is more of the narrative around what the story the company is um this piece here is is a good one just the differentiator slash like right to win understanding like what makes this company unique and and why they're going to succeed if we think they will um this again is usually what we'll sorry usually what we'll get back from the company in that initial round of questions if we're saying like OK like why do you guys actually want to work with multiplier like what do you need and in that they'll typically outline some objectives OK we want to be doing XY and Z in five years you know we want to enter this many markets so for these guys this break even acquire some weaker companies what do they want from us again this is really just a lot of filling in and this is again something that the partners fill in here just how we add value sometimes I would say that can be given in an e-mail to us or once we share this document they'll put it in but Just sort of depends um reputational or upside risk on the customer side this is a great way to identify obviously who the customers are so we going on you know any any news we can find or anything on their website and doing a little research on that customer quotes trying not to pull from their website but from whether it be like Google review or any sort of you know Better Business Bureau anything like that just trying to get some information on how they are you know sitting with their customers and then the risk piece is like customer concentration for example you know can they serve only a really niche sub sector of the solar market or is it more hinging on like a policy for example so just identifying what a potential area of risk would be for the customer but this one doesn't have let me see if I have one with investor risk because I think that's an important one to have um reputational upside or risk for the investor piece is somewhat repeated in the quality of investors but that's more just the surface level like hey do we know who the other investors are is there anything concerning about that and then quality of investors will go more in depth on you know are they specialized in the space or is it just they got money from an accelerator and and that's that key personnel it's sort of like the management but a little more narrative less like cut and dry so this is kind of commentary that we'll get from the partners and their meetings with them or sort of gut reactions from us so you can just see like the kind of information from getting here it's a mix of you know their background but then also you know some personal notes of like where they've been prior and married with three kids like great just helpful to have information in here um board understanding of multipliers role again that one's a little bit tricky because it's it's not always clear sometimes this doesn't come up until we're actually in a negotiation but otherwise it will be something from the company saying like hey you know we you know our board is aligned with what we're trying to do here terms offered were expected this is sometimes given other times we wait until we're in negotiations as well but sometimes you'll see in the like hey you know response to what do you guys want with multiplier like what what can we do for you they'll include you know in exchange for 3% of the company or you know anywhere from 3:00 to 5:00 percent is typically what we see and then some terms around that cash on hand all of this is from the company so either given in an investor pitch attack or yeah I think it's really the only place and let's see we get a lot of that from any outside sources do you guys use pitchbook we I don't use Facebook very often just because I don't have an account with them I use crunchbase more and but yeah something like Facebook would be very helpful I think in all of us and all of this but yeah I've done I've used pitchbook a couple times to figure out investor rounds but that's it so it's it's also like having been on the company side of this and CEO side pitch book actually doesn't it's not very good I like that it's got a lot of accurate it's not accurate it's got all sorts of data in it it looks nice but it's surprisingly inaccurate so I would yeah really I would really push this onto the company yeah and it's the kind of this is really cool from decks I think yeah yeah whatever you need to make the decision whatever you're looking for you just say like here's the form fill it out like that's beyond that I wouldn't I wouldn't pay for pitch book to do this type of stuff because it's not working no especially when it's yeah it's not really accurate I think it's it's that's where we find it a lot more challenging quality investors so you can kind of see just a brief on this company or on this investor for example a lot of this language is taken from either the investor website let me see on this one this one is good because you have information on each of the firms that have invested their AUM if it's a firm that I haven't heard of or really stands out as like I think I've actually ever seen this one give a little more information but obviously there's these are big names and we know most of them so just helpful to highlight you know they're 81 figures yeah yeah very cool ohh alrighty moving into legal entity this is again typically just some you know just some weird Googling you can typically figure out where a company is is incorporated or their structure share class structure is something that doesn't necessarily come along until we have their cap table which is is given in some cases in other cases it's not on doing litigation is just Googling figuring out anyone getting sued IP and that stuff is typically given from the company's not necessarily a lot of detail around that usually just saying like we have a patent on XYZ process or we've filed in the US and we're filing in Europe not a ton of information there customer concentration risk again similar to that other piece that we talked about just identifying like are there any major risks like is this customer base going to exist for the next 15 years or the next like 6 months supplier dependencies again similar fragmented market in this case we're talking about the flower market so yeah it makes sense uh cap table just putting in some important figures just understanding you know who the majority investors are and and any of these valuation date is either from the company or from crunch base if we can figure that out rarely do we see the investor rights or our independent valuation of that we've ever come up with our own evaluation of any of these companies just cause just not at that at that point yet um to the sort of a repeat of above but just making sure the management ends you know wider board are aligned on the exit strategy because again the exit is it's the name of the game for all of our engagements and that was that was that was actually going to be a question so like yeah is it really is it is exit really the goal here is it the primary yeah so any any of the companies that we're going to take on & the path is always exit so exit within is there a target time frame I would say probably three to five years um and that would maybe be a little generous on the on the longer end yeah uh competitive landscape and key threats this is helpful just to see basically who's out there and you know this was a good example of a company that had been acquired in the last you know year and the background they raised and everything this would be a good one to just be able to swallow a lot of information quickly and then the last piece is just partner commentary this is just any you know any last minute notes or follow up from the partner that have been included in the e-mail or just helpful to have here in one place so this is again just can range from I like them to hey here here's what I think you should do in terms of this capital raise in the next you know year got it OK so then this will get sent over to both partners again just for review um Sophia correct me if I'm wrong I don't think we typically get a lot of questions on on this initially sometimes I would say we then end up meeting with the company if there's like things that we can't fill out on here for example revenue and burn rate and runway that stuff that's really hard to obviously determine without company input so we end up meeting with them and going over a little bit of that but to your point though I think that is an easy thing the company didn't sell out very quickly because they have the information perfect uh should we switch back to the other screen that I will share mine in a second any questions on that or is that all somewhat self-explanatory that all makes sense it all makes sense so anything else on this screen we're so that was the due diligence that mark version 3.0 yeah so typically just language wise it goes like right up version 1 and then right up version like 2 with the commentary included and then it goes to due diligence version 1 and there's not really due diligence version 2 then there's just sort of yeah final notes and so version 4 here that's basically the final version of three that gets signed off on is that kind of right exactly Yep so after that we'll then move into negotiations alright and then we also see so that that's like the diligence process for one specific deal now you also have the CRM that you're managing where are you using for CRM it's funny that take a spreadsheet is perfectly fine by the way ohh it's a spreadsheet alright don't worry do you want me to share my screen just so you can see with the kind of information that's kept in there sure ohh sure cause whether that's also one of the things that kind of overlapped with me Jen in terms of what we're doing right so here is our our beautiful CRM just going very briefly by each column here status is the most important one just identifies like where we are so if Jonathan or jigger reaches out and says hey like you know what do we have on queen jewel for example right here we weren't getting to know the company and we've done you know the 1st right upon them so that would be that initial one page with partner commentary or waiting for partner commentary so I'm just going to throw out one to get in your pipeline I'm an investor and an advisor but it's a it is like such a bullseye is tallus age do you know do you know those guys hours ago I don't think I do TALUS um yeah I think I think uh it's it's spot on the only it is international at this point like they were initially international they came to the US because of the IRA and then now they're because of the risk there they're kind of going back international but it's renewable ammonia it's very asset intensive but but very nice IR's on a per project basis they don't have to rely on incentives in the right market they've got a fantastic CEO really good investors tamasik is an investor material impact as an investor I don't know if they would I don't know if they would do the kind of terms you're looking for but it it's it's it's at least worth happening yeah we're having the conversation so look at them yeah yeah alright we'll check them out here we would dog as the CEO so OK and again Full disclosure I've got I've got a financial interest there but that one just jumps to mind for me yeah so sorry sorry for interrupting no no no not a problem at all so detailed status is something that we update manually just based on how we you know what we done to date and when was it shared basically company name this is all stuff that gets done in the initial piece so when we get that first e-mail for example from the project saying hey just spoke with you know Todd who's the CEO of majin then we go in and manually write in you know getting to know the company you know nothing done yet or nothing done today linked to the company name refund on the sector and like what are they actually doing so it's very simple they wanna gig marketplace doesn't mean that much but technician marketplace with AI powered field service workflows like that gives you a very quick understanding of what that company does and so you go in and input all of this data lead partner as a second partner second partner met them yes or no and putting the contact information for our primary contact at the company other contacts are you know if we were referred by a certain individual or by a different firm for example umm deal sources is similar to you know the partner or if it's from another firm value add is is typically blank this was something we used in the beginning just for partners to have commentary but that's the style since moved on to the document that we were looking at before compensation investing are are helpful just to have this on one easy to look at place this is again something that comes along the way just basic deal terms as well due diligence efforts to date this is something we get updated very similar to the detailed status but just saying what's been done and then you know additional work to be done pretty self-explanatory you can see it's not used very frequently because we typically just know like where we're at if we have to do something do it competitors not very relevant on the CRM generally Christy last date this is one that I really wish it was easier for us to automate in a way or just keep track of umm but the challenge that we see I think this could be just change these columns to like one of us first date last date just because we don't necessarily know when Jonathan or Jagger was in touch with the company but it's helpful to know like when did that first e-mail come in and when was the last time we reached out to them company folder is a hyperlink to the Dropbox that we put in so that each company has a company folder here if we can get over to that each company we work with has a company folder here and so that is just a link to the specific company folder so you can quickly access all of the documents related to a single company in there and then next steps are like if we're you know on pause or something or next steps from a partner or any other commentary so just a a catch all phrase at the end here that's a good CRM you don't need Salesforce that's for sure so uh if you were to think about the opportunity we've been focused on this we've been focused on the diligence piece is there value for you on the CRM kind of management side as well um I'm I'm torn like I think yes but also I think part of the CRM that's helpful for us is making sure that we know where we are with every company so like a status on here doesn't change without us changing it and like the the order won't change unless I go through and do my custom sort or like any of the conditional formatting so I think it's it's as annoying as it is I think it is helpful that we have to know where we are it forces you to do your job yeah yeah OK alright so I think that's super helpful so we'll focus the conversation around the diligence we do have some of the work that we're doing with majin around essentially CRM so as you can imagine we were we were talking about investor matching more broadly it's people people matching so that like they were trying to find a strategic partner that's working in the automotive space that's doing charging infrastructure who's everybody who the right people that you know jigger and John know or whoever's on the board or whatever but that ultimately can yeah you can flow that into like a a like a CRM for sales or closing around or in this case a sales pipeline for your own firm but that's not let's say like that's definitely later um so honing in on the diligence piece W you want to show a little bit of the the competition and the work alright let's make sure I can try that get this right I think this will work ohh out so I can see what I'm sharing where do you get the video off the top like for us yeah we'll try that again speaker there we go OK um what we did for the headline attack challenge and so there's you'll see that what we have is a couple of pieces of software that you read reasonably large chunks of your workflow but not that it's not integrated into your workflow at the moment but I'll try to explain this in the context of your workflow with the climate challenge we had a very tight time frame and we wanted to speed up the process by which people could apply and also increase the number of applicants by reducing a lot of the friction so on the climate tech challenge website you could go in this area where you could start your application by just putting in a domain name and what that would do is to go through and fill out the application form so this is this is putting in for like a tech company which is not a final company you don't want automatically filled all of this out with a combination of perplexity searches and reading some other alarms that the flesh it out so I as the applicant can now go through and basically correct itself yeah so it's mostly accurate um it's got uh bits that are not accurate at all it doesn't know about funding rates today or you know about your use of funds obviously that's not public information but it's it's able to pull a bunch of that stuff together I could then submit it and then I get a a link that lets me get into the um into the site and um if I'm an applicant I'll have access to my application page if I go into here you know you know I I'll be able to go through and and edit it ongoing but the other thing I can do is I can also get preliminary feedback on my application from an AI judge so that I can use that to approve the application which will cover that there we go so it gives it gives some basic feedback using the criteria we've we've placed it in the system and and so the way we did that um is let's see uh go around to judges um We created to evaluation frameworks here uh if I go to manage you know we've got a rubric rates feedback which has a bunch of criteria and and scoring mechanisms and yeah helpful and so this is this is a rubric that could be used by a human or an AI judge and then we've defined AI judges so this was our semifinal judge using O4 mini and it basically we have yeah prompts that are given so those prompts are combined with the rubric and then we can run that against um any of the applications if I go into judging uh judging assignments let's take a look at you know here's one yeah so here the AI went through and you know used that rubric follow the prompts provided you know feedback on you know we asked it to be you know reasonably terrace this is the overview these were the scores that you can see the very specific feedback gave as I have justified at school or you know additional feedback and recommendations that it was given and you can see actually the raw API response for debugging purposes so we could also so we can make sure we were you know we would sample all of these to try and make sure the AI was aligned and so that one of the things that we did for the semifinals is we had the AI and that we had numerous human judges reviewing the same thing so we were able to compare the AI results with you know four or five human judges judging the same thing and we'll find that it was basically in alignment we had we had actually done a simpler for another product we could have a similar type of alignment analysis where we doing different models different ways they're doing evaluation comparing or one of their human reviewers are they different type of program where they had multiple stage gates and deciding whether to yeah for granted yeah it's almost like being able to get um yeah how well detailed scores how well aligned against feedback the human analysis and umm you know lots of lots of tools that we had built to try and make sure that the 5050 AI systems were working the way we want it to work based on your information and so yeah this was you know for this particular process we were able to create this this workflow for getting that initial sort of semi final evaluation of which teams you know we want to bring into the finals by the human human feedback with the AI feedback again the human judges could have gone and done their judging in this system we didn't because of time transmit didn't want to not had that risk this system was basically built in about three weeks um from something from the ground up and you know there were a lot of other things we need to manage like sponsorships and umm social media trying to track so this was an ability for us to look at and this might be also interesting to you if you've got a lot of applications coming in a daily snapshot of what's actually come into the pipeline where where you're at what's what's happening this will be across all of the applications uh you know on a daily basis for for for that sort of update so this is this is sort of one way so this so this application itself configurable so you know your your particular version one type of data that you're looking for could be set up so that's collected in combination some of it's you know AI search some of its yeah some of it is uh you're coming in through the the actual company themselves you know coming into you there's there's another piece of software which you know we're we're building out currently which is managing proposals and opportunities and yeah again this is this is sort of where your workflow once you've got all of that information replicating the types of documents that you're actually creating where you know you can have these different sections filled out based on what's coming through you can edit it you know you can edit it yourself or you can actually you know if you wanted to see what you know different AI models would do like perplexity O3 in terms of enriching off of their knowledge base you know being able to click here this is using GPT 41 mini but you could take a different way and you can see how it's going through and enriching the content and then another interesting did is you know here because this came off an RFP the RFP had a whole bunch of requirements so this is a gap analysis where it's looking at what information we have versus what the requirements were and while that's you know checking off you know an RFP versus not you know you have your list of requirements so at any given page is sort of enriching the information you have you could be you know you could have your list of requirements and checking to see you know what's missing and and what needs to be updated there's you know to the point on the CRM side you know one of the things we're we're also building in is you know knowledge base where we can you know scrape websites get get a whole bunch of information that can be used to you know when you're doing that enriching of a field back that currently is enriched you know from a combination of what's in uh you know the AI systems that we're using whether it's perplexity or yeah open AI and also what we've got in the knowledge base which could be our own you know document services methodologies through you know this sort of demo site but different types of documents that we've we've amassed or custom information yeah our own our own research like what's in your CRM document so got it and so the the idea here is to try and just make it very easy to you know work through you know large amounts of of documents data workflows so and I could see for you know what your use cases it's combination of some of that you know front facing let's let the companies we're working with yeah have simple access first we're saying just like drop your drop your URL and you know get you know drop a pitch deck in maybe even something where you can see see an e-mail address you know our communications and it's just pulling that and it's just enriching out that um the company's information she works which you can then go through and enrich check against your requirements as you go through each page you know your yeah training partner can have log in and it could at some point you can say OK I need you to review this and then they can go in and see it whether it's they're looking at the full information or a subset of the information we got and then you know just moving it moving it through that pipeline so the nice thing about sort of how we've been working with these things we build we're building components that are sort of remixable so a number of the ways that we're working with AI to process the documents these are sort of generalized So what we're using for climate tech thing we're also using for driving background here so and also from agent so that's that's just gives you an idea of some of the things that we've you know we've put together you know for for some of these other use cases so that's yeah probably not terribly far off here use case in terms of what we've got no I think I think I think that all looks great honestly it's very helpful to have be able to take like offload so much of that and and automate so much of that process so that we can go in and and review that as opposed to having to kind of dig it from scratch any idea I think the the piece that is exciting is like if we are I know they're in the process of building out their website and there is sort of a you know get in touch with us this is your your main point of entry if it's not through just an e-mail having that as like a field on the website basically of hey you put in your information here and then we go on the back end we can pull all this together and sort of build it out without even needing to let them know what's happening I think that's a really helpful prospect for sure how are they building on the website are they working with a firm to do that or I believe they are I've only gotten back end access just through just like a square site but I don't know who's actually building Jonathan tried to publish it like last week but he might have taken it down since then it's still being doubted go but it was just a basic text field yeah sure contact us yeah I could see that as a really easy plugin for hey yeah through your your company URL in year 2 yeah definitely yeah and and the nice thing that worked really well for the challenge was because we had you know because it was that simple with the URL and like we immediately as long as someone hit submit like that was there in our system and so even if they didn't fully submit through the thing now we at least know that someone from this company who started the process and then we could reach out and say hey OK cool you know like if they went all the way through and they got into the system mark Lawson but if they didn't at least you know it's like it's it's kind of a a bit of a marketing type of culture in there too which is cool so yeah and I think one thing that would be probably you know this is an area we've been spending a lot of time thinking about you know we've made it which is do when do we use tools like perplexity and open AI and when are we using LM since we're running on our own infrastructure because you know you have a lot of information coming in that's you know proprietary and you know to your point like there's a lot of information that's not in on Facebook um you know you can certainly do preliminary spray but at some point you're CRM stock you know some pretty useful stuff so you know you don't necessarily want that even even with the you know even within enterprise agreement without the I you know there's there's efficiency so yeah I think that's you know that's also something to think about uh we're certainly building in the capability to run the secure parts that don't have to interface with LM yeah yes and LM that's running in our own secure environments yeah I think that's a really important call out like we really don't for that exact reason like for the fact that we're dealing like it'd be awesome if I could throw a pitch deck into you know chat and just say hey like what is giving you all the information on this but yeah not not secure not not approved of being able to yeah work around that I think would be really really helpful yeah and and and warrant to the companies you're working with yeah exactly and like I mean if if we have to spend less time going back and forth to them and that means they can get onboarded quicker and and begin actually working with you know with Jonathan and and Jagger like that's that's a win for everyone involved so I I totally see the the value add here talk here it's been great yeah yeah and I guess uh you know there's a lot we could do how do you what do you think the best path is here like is there a budget to do anything right and I'm sure that's like yeah yeah that is a that is a jigger Jonathan question yeah sure um but I know so we I know just for for context are meeting with Jonathan next week umm and so it would be helpful for us to kind of update him on what we've gone through and and figured out here and then get his thoughts on it um what is the day of that and we could try to get you something and maybe the day before that is that's Tuesday yeah yeah alright and then so I know that's a quick turn around but I know we're also going to meet later in that week as well so we need to what do you think the best way of communicating information to John is um in terms of what should we like like do we do like a one page do dat do like couple slides like what is what is most useful if you were to say hey here's an opportunity what what's the best what what how what would you what do you want us to send you yeah I would say of 1 whatever is easiest for you if it's A1 pager a deck is totally fine I think yeah either of those will be totally fine and we can look at them with him just so it makes more sense West think we should try to do like a very not not a 10 page proposal but like hey here's the concept here's the one here's the we talked about yeah but yeah absolutely and we'll we'll we'll talk a little bit about yeah because these tools are you know the things we're doing they're they're evolving and you know so the question is do we evolve this with you guys I think there's a lot of ways about how this works obviously yeah this is this is something that you know clearly has value for you guys my guess is you are not the only you know organization with a with a workflow that looks like that right yeah and yeah I mean I'm I'm so just on a personal note I'm so curious about what the diligence process looks like at at you know the full VC scale of like you're obviously not gonna use publicly available tool but like you've gotta be so I've I've been I've been talking to several different firms and it's amazing the difference so like even in the Bay Area like some people that are like big well funded are just not doing anything and then because they're not it's like we've got the manpower for it so like may as well just they don't need it right so but at the same time they're going Oh my God like I talked to so and so and they're doing XY and Z and we gotta do something and so it is it's definitely changing but it's it's all over the place so yeah I mean it's it's definitely gonna be one of those where if you get you build out a system for yourself that works really well and you can get your diligence done you know days and weeks before anyone else like you can you're going to get priority on a deal thank you it's just I see it as being yeah not a not obvious but one yeah yeah totally yeah yeah but yeah it's also you know when I was at Deloitte it was amazing I mean we beat the number of multi $1,000,000 you know enterprise knowledge management deals we had deployed successfully and then you know what's our own internal knowledge management the share drive right like yeah it's like all these proposals sitting in one you know share drive and it's like guys come on surely you gotta be doing this you know and it was just like this is yeah anyway but so like it's not surprising to me that you know you have VC's that have like invested in all these wonderful AI companies and they're like doing all this and they have like literally know like where is our Word document with this information like come on yeah it's just that's just the way it is so you know anyway be surprised what you could do with word these days have you really yeah ohh God ohh well guys this has been very very helpful for us I hope I hope we provided a little more color and clarity on what what our process looks like if you have questions I know you you know feel free to reach out and we can help us as we can but this would be yeah very exciting stuff super helpful thank you cool thanks alright bye having
