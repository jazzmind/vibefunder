## 📋 Recommendations for Reaching 40% Coverage

### Immediate Actions (Est. +25.47% coverage needed):

#### 1. Component Testing Priority (Est. +10% coverage)
```typescript
// Priority components to test
- CampaignCard.tsx
- PaymentForm.tsx
- UserProfile.tsx
- Navigation.tsx
- Footer.tsx
```

#### 2. Utility Function Coverage (Est. +5% coverage)
```typescript
// Quick wins in utilities
- lib/utils.ts
- lib/validation.ts
- lib/formatting.ts
- lib/api-helpers.ts
```

#### 3. Service Layer Testing (Est. +8% coverage)
```typescript
// Business logic services
- services/campaign.service.ts
- services/payment.service.ts
- services/user.service.ts
```

#### 4. Branch Coverage Improvement (Est. +3% coverage)
- Add edge case testing
- Test all conditional paths
- Error scenario coverage
- Boundary condition testing

### Timeline Assessment:
- **Phase 1:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (145% of target)
- **Phase 2:** 70% complete (files created, coverage gap)
- **Estimated time to 40%:** 1-2 additional days
