## Testing Standards & Best Practices

### Code Coverage Requirements

#### Minimum Coverage by File Type
| File Type | Minimum Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| API Routes | 90% | Critical for data integrity |
| Payment Processing | 95% | Financial operations require highest coverage |
| Authentication | 90% | Security-critical code |
| React Components | 80% | UI components with user interaction |
| Utility Functions | 85% | Shared code requires thorough testing |

### Test Writing Guidelines

#### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Feature/Component Name', () => {
  // Setup
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await cleanupTestData();
    // Additional setup
  });

  // Teardown
  afterEach(async () => {
    await cleanupTestData();
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  describe('Specific Functionality', () => {
    it('should perform expected behavior with descriptive name', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const testData = createTestData();
      
      // Act
      const result = await functionUnderTest(testData);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toMatchExpectedStructure();
    });

    it('should handle error cases gracefully', async () => {
      // Test error scenarios
    });

    it('should validate edge cases', async () => {
      // Test boundary conditions
    });
  });
});
```

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Happy path scenarios
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Edge cases
- [ ] Input validation

2. **Time Constraints**: Testing taking longer than estimated
   - *Mitigation*: Prioritize critical paths, adjust timeline
   
3. **Team Resistance**: Developers reluctant to write tests
   - *Mitigation*: Training, pair programming, incentives
   
4. **Flaky Tests**: Tests failing intermittently
   - *Mitigation*: Proper isolation, mock external services

## Budget & Resources

### Time Investment
- 2 developers full-time for 8 weeks
- 1 QA engineer 50% allocation
- Tech lead 20% allocation

### Tool Costs
- Codecov Pro: $10/month

## Conclusion

Achieving 80% test coverage is critical for VibeFunder's success as a financial platform. This 8-week plan provides a structured approach to systematically improve coverage while maintaining development velocity. The investment in testing will pay dividends through reduced bugs, faster development cycles, and increased confidence in production deployments.

Regular monitoring and adjustment of this plan will ensure we meet our coverage goals while delivering a robust, reliable platform for our users.
