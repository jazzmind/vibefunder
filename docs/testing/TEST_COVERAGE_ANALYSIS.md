## Tooling Recommendations

### Essential Tools to Add
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/react": "^14.0.0",     // Component testing
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.0.0", // User interactions
    "msw": "^2.0.0",                          // API mocking
    "jest-junit": "^16.0.0",                  // CI reporting
    "jest-extended": "^4.0.0",                // Better matchers
    "@percy/jest": "^1.0.0",                  // Visual testing
    "jest-performance-testing": "^1.0.0"      // Performance tests
  }
}
```

### CI/CD Integration Requirements
- Coverage gates (minimum 80%)
- Test execution on every PR
- Coverage trend tracking
- Automatic test failure notifications
- Performance regression detection

## Conclusion

VibeFunder's current test coverage of **5.5%** represents a critical risk for a platform handling financial transactions. The analysis reveals:

1. **122+ source files with zero test coverage**
2. **Critical payment and authentication paths untested**
3. **No frontend component testing**
4. **Infrastructure issues preventing test execution**

The comprehensive testing plan outlined in `TESTING_PLAN.md` provides a clear path to achieve 80% coverage over 8 weeks. Immediate focus should be on:
1. Fixing test infrastructure
2. Testing payment processing
3. Covering authentication flows
4. Implementing component tests

Without significant investment in test coverage, VibeFunder faces substantial risks including:
- Financial losses from payment bugs
- Security breaches from untested authentication
- Poor user experience from untested UI
- Regulatory compliance failures
- Loss of user trust from production issues

**Recommendation**: Pause feature development and dedicate 2 developers full-time for 8 weeks to achieve minimum viable test coverage before any production deployment.
