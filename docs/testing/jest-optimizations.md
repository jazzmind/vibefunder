# Jest Configuration Optimizations

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented for Jest testing in the VibeFunder project to achieve sub-5-minute test execution times.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Worker Management
- **Auto-detection of CPU cores**: Uses `require('os').cpus().length - 1` for local development
- **CI optimization**: Limited to 2 workers in CI environments to prevent resource contention
- **Maximum cap**: Limited to 8 workers to prevent diminishing returns

### 2. Caching Improvements
- **Enabled Jest cache**: `cache: true`
- **Custom cache directory**: `node_modules/.cache/jest`
- **Clear mocks**: `clearMocks: true` and `restoreMocks: true` for test isolation

### 3. Optimized Test Timeout
- **Local development**: Reduced from 30s to 15s
- **CI environments**: Maintained 30s for stability
- **Dynamic configuration**: Based on `process.env.CI`

### 4. Enhanced Module Resolution
- **Additional aliases**: Added `@components/*` and `@utils/*` mappings
- **Optimized module directories**: Added `<rootDir>` to search paths
- **ESM handling**: Improved transform ignore patterns for modern modules

### 5. Transform Optimizations
- **Isolated modules**: Enabled `isolatedModules: true` for faster compilation
- **Modern targets**: Set `target: 'es2020'` and `module: 'esnext'`
- **Reduced transformIgnorePatterns**: Only transform necessary node_modules

### 6. Test Path Filtering
- **Exclude helper files**: Skip `*-helpers.{js,ts,tsx}` files
- **Skip utility directories**: Exclude `__tests__/utils/` and `__tests__/setup/`
- **Focused test matching**: Only `.test.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` files

### 7. Coverage Configuration
- **Coverage thresholds**: Set realistic targets (70-75%)
- **Multiple reporters**: Text, HTML, LCOV for different use cases
- **Exclude patterns**: Skip config files and coverage directories

### 8. CI/CD Integration
- **Jest-JUnit reporter**: XML output for CI systems
- **Optimized CI settings**: `--ci --coverage --maxWorkers=2`
- **Structured output**: Consistent reporting across environments

## New NPM Scripts

### Core Testing
- `npm test` - Run all tests with optimized settings
- `npm run test:watch` - Watch mode for development
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage reports

### Specialized Testing
- `npm run test:unit` - Unit tests only
- `npm run test:integration` - Integration tests
- `npm run test:ci` - CI-optimized execution
- `npm run test:staged` - Test related files only

### Coverage and Reporting
- `npm run test:coverage:html` - HTML coverage reports
- `npm run coverage:lcov` - LCOV format for external tools
- `npm run test:benchmark` - Performance benchmarking

## Performance Targets

### Time Targets
- **Unit tests**: < 30 seconds
- **Full coverage**: < 2 minutes
- **CI execution**: < 1.5 minutes
- **Overall suite**: < 5 minutes

### Coverage Targets
- **Branches**: 70%
- **Functions**: 75%
- **Lines**: 75%
- **Statements**: 75%

## Configuration Files Modified

### jest.config.js
- Added dynamic worker calculation
- Enabled caching with custom directory
- Optimized transform settings
- Added coverage thresholds
- Enhanced module resolution

### package.json
- Simplified test scripts to use Jest directly
- Added new specialized test commands
- Integrated jest-junit reporter
- Added benchmark script

## Environment Considerations

### Local Development
- Uses CPU cores - 1 for optimal performance
- 15-second test timeout for faster feedback
- Full reporter output for debugging

### CI Environment
- Limited to 2 workers to prevent resource conflicts
- 30-second timeout for stability
- JUnit XML output for integration
- LCOV coverage for external services

## Monitoring and Benchmarking

### Benchmark Script
Run `npm run test:benchmark` to:
- Measure performance across different test types
- Compare against established targets
- Generate performance reports
- Track improvements over time

### Performance Metrics
The benchmark tracks:
- Average execution times
- Success rates
- Min/max execution times
- Overall performance targets

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Keep test files focused and small
- Use helper functions but exclude from test runs
- Organize tests by feature/domain
- Maintain clear test descriptions

### Performance Tips
- Mock external dependencies
- Use `beforeAll`/`afterAll` for expensive setup
- Prefer unit tests over integration tests where possible
- Keep database operations minimal in tests

## Dependencies Added

- **jest-junit**: XML reporting for CI integration
- **Enhanced ESM support**: Better handling of modern JavaScript modules
- **Optimized TypeScript compilation**: Faster ts-jest processing

## Results Expected

With these optimizations, the test suite should:
- Complete in under 5 minutes total
- Provide fast feedback in development
- Scale efficiently in CI environments
- Maintain high code coverage standards
- Offer reliable performance monitoring

## Future Improvements

Potential additional optimizations:
- Test sharding for very large test suites
- Parallel database instances for integration tests
- Custom test environment for faster setup
- Memory optimization for long-running test suites
